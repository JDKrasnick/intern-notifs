 * once, by a person, from a page the employer controls, and recorded here as
 * evidence — which is what separates a reviewed source from a guessed one.
 *
 * Admission is defined in `docs/lever-company-onboarding-plan.md`. This file is
 * the machine-readable half of it, so a board cannot reach production without
 * the evidence that admitted it.
