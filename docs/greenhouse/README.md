# Greenhouse monitoring

InternNotifs reads the public Greenhouse Job Board API for reviewed employer
boards. It never submits applications and never trusts an unreviewed board
token or application host.

## Documents

- [Architecture](architecture.md) — deployed queue, worker, shadow, publication,
  retry, and alert flow.
- [Ingestion plan](ingestion-plan.md) — source contract, mapping, quality gates,
  and rollout requirements.
- [Registry expansion plan](registry-expansion-plan.md) — broad discovery,
  deterministic verification, evidence review, and production promotion.

## Current operating contract

- The independently deployable `InternNotifsGreenhouse` stack imports the
  retained DynamoDB tables and does not own the main application resources.
- EventBridge dispatches reviewed boards every thirty minutes. Published boards
  run on every dispatch; shadow boards run on staggered three-hour checks.
- A FIFO SQS queue preserves ordering per board and deduplicates a board within
  the dispatch window.
- Lambda consumes batches of ten with maximum concurrency four.
- Shadow boards write only isolated source checkpoints and logs.
- Published boards use the catalog poller, quiet first baseline, link
  validation, DynamoDB deduplication, and user alert path.
- Each request to the Greenhouse jobs API has an eight-second timeout.
- Individual failed SQS records retry without replaying successful records and
  move to a dedicated dead-letter queue after four receives.

No reviewed board is promoted merely because the worker exists. Promotion
still requires its registry status to change from `shadow` to `published`.
