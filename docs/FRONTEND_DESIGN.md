# InternNotifs frontend design

## The design to build

InternNotifs should feel like a sharp personal job-search tool, not a generic form app. The interface needs enough personality to be memorable, while staying quiet when a user is scanning opportunities.

Adopt **Focused Editorial** as the product direction:

- Use a warm off-white canvas, ink-black primary text, and one controlled teal signal color.
- Give each screen a clear editorial hierarchy: a small context label, a decisive headline, then the task.
- Let structure—not large empty areas, floating controls, or decoration—create calm.
- Use compact surfaces with clear borders instead of shadows everywhere.
- Make the primary action a solid ink button. Teal is for selected/filter states and useful metadata, not every interactive element.

This replaces the current "generic settings form" look with a more intentional, student-friendly product while preserving native iPhone conventions.

## What to correct from the current direction

The existing onboarding screenshot exposes four issues:

1. The form is vertically centered, leaving a very large unintentional blank area above it. Short setup screens should start near the top safe area and scroll when the keyboard appears.
2. The headline, chips, input, and button do not share a consistent visual rhythm. They need one content column, predictable gaps, and matching control heights.
3. The system mixes default blue text buttons with custom outlined chips. A primary action should read as a real, full-width action.
4. Large all-caps chip labels and placeholder-only fields make the product feel more like a prototype than a tool users can trust.

## Alternative art directions

Use these as discussion samples before changing the direction again. The first is recommended because it is distinctive without making job information harder to scan.

| Direction | Sample personality | Best use | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Focused Editorial (recommended)** | Ink, off-white, teal signal; strong type and slim bordered cards | A calm all-purpose mobile product | Requires restraint with the teal accent |
| Utility Ledger | White, graphite, blue; dense rows and status labels | Power users tracking many applications | Can feel sterile and crowded for first-time users |
| Opportunity Radar | Deep navy, electric aqua, brighter status chips | A more energetic discovery experience | Can overemphasize decoration and make alerts feel noisy |

### Focused Editorial sample: onboarding

```text
YOUR ALERTS
Make InternNotifs yours.
Pick the roles worth interrupting you for. You can change this at any time.

Role categories
[ AI/ML ] [ Grad ] [ SWE ✓ ] [ Quant ]
[ Product ] [ Design ]

Specific keywords (optional)
[ e.g. backend, robotics, research                    ]

[              Enable alerts and continue              ]
We’ll ask for notification permission next.
```

The content starts 42 pt below the safe area, with a 20 pt gutter on both sides. The chips wrap naturally, but every chip keeps a 48 pt minimum height. The action is full-width and visually grounded.

### Focused Editorial sample: role feed

```text
[ Search roles, companies, locations                    ]
[ Filter roles ]

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Datadog                                               │
│ Software Engineering Intern                           │
│ New York, NY · Summer 2027                            │
│ $52–$58 / hour                                        │
│ [ APPLIED ]                                           │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

[ ▣ Roles ]                 [ ♧ Saved ]              [ ◯ Profile ]
```

Navigation, search, headers, and cards all align to the same 20 pt edge. Cards are 16 pt radius, use a one-pixel slate border, and have a 12 pt gap—no floating/shadow-heavy treatment.

### Focused Editorial sample: profile

```text
Application profile

Full name
[ Jordan Lee                                           ]
Email
[ jordan@example.com                                   ]
Location
[ Boston, MA                                           ]

[                    Upload résumé                     ]

[                     Save profile                      ]

Job alerts
Job alerts                                         [ on ]
```

Profile is a single scrollable form with visible labels. Inputs, buttons, chips, and section headings never acquire an extra local horizontal margin; only the page container owns horizontal padding.

## Design tokens

| Token | Value | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Canvas | `#F8FAFC` | All page backgrounds |
| Surface | `#FFFFFF` | Inputs and cards |
| Ink | `#0F172A` | Headlines, primary actions, active navigation |
| Body | `#334155` | Standard control text |
| Muted | `#64748B` | Supporting copy and inactive navigation |
| Border | `#CBD5E1` | Inputs and neutral chips |
| Soft border | `#E2E8F0` | Card and section separation |
| Signal teal | `#0E7490` | Selected category, company metadata, eyebrow labels |
| Danger | `#B91C1C` | Destructive action only |

Use a four-point spacing scale: `4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 44`. Standard controls are 52 pt high; chips are at least 48 pt high so they meet Android's larger touch-target guidance while remaining comfortable on iPhone.

The current release intentionally ships a light appearance only. Do not claim automatic Dark Mode until semantic light/dark token sets and physical-device checks exist; a consistently light interface is preferable to a partially inverted one.

Typography should stay simple:

| Use | Style |
| --- | --- |
| Context / eyebrow | 12 pt, bold, 1.1 pt tracking |
| Screen title | 32 pt, extra-bold, slight negative tracking |
| Section title | 22 pt, bold |
| Job title / primary content | 17 pt, semibold or bold |
| Body / input | 16 pt, regular |
| Supporting metadata | 14–16 pt, regular |
| Helper copy | 13 pt, regular |

## Layout rules

Every screen follows these rules. They are as important as colors and type.

1. Use a 20 pt horizontal page gutter. Lists receive the gutter through `contentContainerStyle`; individual cards and inputs must not add their own horizontal margins.
2. A content screen starts at the top of the safe area. Only deliberate empty, success, or account-gate states may center their content.
3. Keep a 12 pt gap between related controls, 24 pt between form groups, and 32 pt between major sections.
4. Use one full-width primary action per task. Secondary actions are outlined; destructive actions are separated and red.
5. Use `KeyboardAvoidingView` plus a scroll view for every form. The submit action must remain reachable with the keyboard open.
6. Do not rely on a placeholder as a label. A visible label is required for profile and preference fields; onboarding may pair an obvious field label with a concise placeholder.
7. Allow text to wrap rather than force long role or company names into fixed-height rows.

## Component recipes

### Bottom tab navigation

- Fixed at the bottom of the app content, with a one-pixel top separator and safe-area space below it.
- Three equal-width, 52 pt minimum targets: Roles, Saved, and Profile.
- Every tab combines a familiar icon with a short text label. Use a filled briefcase for the selected Roles tab, bookmark for Saved, and person for Profile.
- Active tab: ink icon and label; inactive tabs: muted outline icon and label. Do not use a bottom-rule-only state or blue system buttons for navigation.
- A tab bar is for moving among these three top-level areas, never for inline actions. Keep it visible while switching sections.
- At 700 pt or wider, replace the bottom bar with the same three destinations in a compact left navigation rail; keep the primary content column centered and no wider than 760 pt.

### Input

- 52 pt high, 12 pt radius, white surface, `#CBD5E1` border.
- 14 pt horizontal inner padding.
- Pair with a 13 pt semibold label, 7–8 pt above the field.
- Use 12 pt after the field unless it completes a group.

### Filter chip

- Minimum 48 pt high; 14 pt horizontal padding; fully rounded.
- Neutral: white surface, slate border, body-colored label.
- Selected: pale teal surface with teal border and dark-teal label.
- Excluded: pale red surface with red border; reserve this state for explicit exclusions only.

### Card

- White surface, 16 pt radius, 16 pt internal padding.
- One-pixel soft border; no required shadow.
- 12 pt gap between cards.
- Company is teal metadata, role is ink, and location/season is muted body text.
- When the signed-in user has an application record for the role, display its current status in a compact teal pill. For example, show **APPLIED** after the user starts the employer handoff; continue to show later statuses such as assessment or interview.

### Save for web

- On the signed-in mobile feed, a deliberate left swipe on an unsaved role reveals a teal bookmark action and saves the role to the shared **Saved** queue. The card returns to its resting position, then shows its **SAVED** status; do not remove it from the feed.
- The reveal uses a short 100 ms follow-through and 120 ms hold before the card settles back. With Reduce Motion enabled, save immediately without movement.
- Saving never opens the employer form. The same account-backed role is available in the responsive web app’s **Saved** queue, where **Open official application** is the clear primary handoff. Keep status changes explicit; opening a form alone must not mark a role applied.
- Expose the same action to assistive technology as **Save for web**, with a hint that it can be applied to later in the web app.

### Hide from feed

- A deliberate right swipe hides a role on the current device only. Reveal a subdued **Hide** action, then remove the card after its short follow-through; this must never remove the role from the catalog, Saved queue, or alerts.
- Replace the card in place with a quiet, static **Role hidden on this device · Undo** row. It is not a popup or toast: it remains in the role’s list position for the current session, so Undo is immediate. Hidden roles are also listed in Profile and can be restored individually.
- Expose **Hide on this device** as an assistive-technology action. A card with both actions must describe left swipe for Save and right swipe for Hide.

### New and seen roles

- For the active signed-in session, keep roles returned by the launch-inbox endpoint above the normal feed in a **New roles** group.
- After the last new card, show a quiet rule divider reading **You’re all caught up**, then label the remainder **Seen roles**.
- Do not use a modal, an alert, or a persistent badge for this boundary. If there are no new roles, omit both labels and render the same simple search/filter-and-list landing page.
- Give each new card a small, one-time arrival moment: an 8 pt lift, a soft teal sheen that fades within 420 ms, and a compact sparkle-plus-**New** marker beside the company. Stagger only the first five cards by 80 ms; never loop, pulse, or use a full-card neon treatment.
- Honor the device Reduce Motion preference by showing the card and static **New** marker without movement. The treatment uses opacity and transforms so it stays smooth without making the list feel busy.

### Buttons

- Primary: 52 pt, 12 pt radius, ink fill, white semibold label.
- Secondary: white fill, slate border, body-colored label.
- Danger: red fill, white label, separated from routine account actions.
- Never use bare colored text as the only primary action for a setup flow.

### Loading states

- Use static, layout-matched skeletons instead of activity wheels or progress bars.
- A loading feed includes the tab row, search field, section copy, and three job-card shapes.
- Let those three card shapes reveal from top to bottom: each starts 10 pt lower, then rises and fades in once over 240 ms, with a 100 ms stagger. Keep the surrounding chrome still, and never loop the animation or add a shimmer sweep.
- Respect Reduce Motion: show the completed skeleton layout immediately when it is enabled. The real roles should replace the shapes without an additional transition, keeping loading quick and legible.
- A loading profile uses headline, field-label, input, and button shapes in the same 20 pt content column as the completed form.
- Skeletons use `#E2E8F0`; buttons may use the slightly darker `#CBD5E1`. They are announced as loading content for assistive technology, but contain no visible loading text.

## Alert settings and application progress

Alert settings live in the **Alerts and filters** portion of Profile. Keep them as one focused sequence, not a maze of sub-screens:

1. Alert permission toggle and role/keyword filters.
2. Company type: FAANG, startups, normal companies, or every company.
3. Optional exclusions for source-marked U.S.-citizenship and advanced-degree requirements. Do not add a sponsorship filter.
4. Delivery timing: immediate or daily digest.
5. Quiet hours: start, end, and timezone.
6. Wording templates with a dark live notification preview.
7. Application reminders and a follow-up interval.

Onboarding must always offer **Continue without alerts**. It may request notification permission only after the user deliberately enables the alert switch and confirms the setup action. If permission is denied, preserve the role preferences, show an inline explanation with a retry action, and never block access to the feed.

Every save uses the same inline feedback treatment: a neutral saving message, a green success confirmation, or a red readable error with **Try again**. Avoid transient spinner-only or alert-only save feedback.

Application progress is initially based only on actions the user takes inside InternNotifs: saving or applying to a role, changing its tracked status, and a follow-up reminder scheduled after the selected interval. Do not imply that an external employer portal updates application progress unless a supported employer integration exists. Deadline reminders belong in the next delivery-service release and require a reliable source deadline.

The notification backend must apply the saved role, company-type, U.S.-citizenship, and advanced-degree filters, delivery cadence, quiet-hours timezone, and per-device deduplication before it delivers. Closed listings are browse-only and never trigger alerts. Use a concise internal role deep link for mobile pushes; the employer application URL remains the explicit handoff after opening a role.

## Screen intent

- **Browse / sign in:** establish trust quickly. Browsing remains useful without an account.
- **Onboarding:** select roles and enable alerts in under a minute. Explain the next permission step before triggering it.
- **Feed:** start with only search and filter controls, then the role list. Each card answers what, where, and when before any secondary detail; tracked roles also expose their current application status.
- **Apply:** make the handoff to the employer explicit. InternNotifs tracks progress; it does not impersonate an employer form.
- **Saved:** show a small, clear status model rather than a complex CRM workflow.
- **Profile:** keep application data, résumé, alerts, support, and destructive account control in clearly separated sections.

## Implementation acceptance checklist

- [ ] Every primary content edge aligns at 20 pt from the viewport.
- [ ] No card or form control adds a second horizontal margin inside a padded list/form container.
- [ ] Onboarding and profile are keyboard-safe and scrollable.
- [ ] The navigation tabs, input fields, chips, and primary buttons meet the minimum touch target.
- [ ] Default `Button` components have been replaced on product surfaces where they would break the visual system.
- [ ] All profile inputs have persistent labels before release.
- [ ] Empty, loading, error, and notification-permission states have specific plain-language copy.

## Authentication

The near-term sign-in screen is compact and email/password based: sign in, create account, and verify email. There is no shared default login; each tester creates their own account.

The intended iPhone-first end state is **Sign in with Apple** as the primary option, with email/password retained as a fallback. Do not present a non-working Apple button. Before enabling it, configure Apple as a Cognito User Pool identity provider and test the full token return path on a physical device.

Required configuration outside the app code:

1. Enable **Sign in with Apple** for `com.internnotifs.app` in Apple Developer.
2. Create an Apple Sign in with Apple key and record its Key ID, Team ID, and private key securely.
3. Create/configure the Apple Services ID and allowed Cognito callback URL.
4. Configure the Apple provider, Cognito hosted domain, OAuth callback/sign-out URLs, and allowed OAuth flows in the Cognito User Pool.
5. Add the mobile auth-session implementation, then test first sign-in, returning sign-in, private relay email, logout, account deletion, and a full TestFlight build.

The Apple private key must remain in AWS/Apple configuration and must never be embedded in Expo environment variables, the mobile binary, or Git.
