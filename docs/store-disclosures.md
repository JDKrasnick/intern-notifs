# App Store and Google Play disclosure worksheet

Prepared for issue #41 from the mobile and Cloudflare production data flows at
base commit `104a41d2af3ab080a621b8687dc84078fe70b200`, including the trust-surface
changes in this branch. Re-audit before submission if the release commit adds
an SDK, login provider, permission, analytics, advertising, payment, or new
profile field.

This is an owner-entry worksheet, not proof that the answers have been
published in App Store Connect or Play Console.

## Shared facts

- The app collects data: **Yes**.
- Data is sold: **No**.
- Data is used for cross-company tracking or advertising: **No**.
- Data is shared with third parties for their own purposes: **No**. Cloudflare,
  Resend, Expo, APNs, and FCM act as service providers for hosting, email, and
  requested push delivery.
- Data is encrypted in transit: **Yes**.
- Account creation is optional; public browsing and installation-scoped alerts
  work without an account.
- Account deletion is available in the app and through the public support page.
- The public privacy-choices/account-deletion URL is
  `https://jdkrasnick.github.io/intern-notifs/support.html#delete-account`.
- The privacy-policy URL is
  `https://jdkrasnick.github.io/intern-notifs/privacy.html`.

Apple defines collection as off-device transmission retained beyond real-time
request handling and requires disclosure of integrated partners' practices.
Google similarly requires disclosure of data transmitted off device, including
data sent by libraries and SDKs. Sources:

- User Privacy Choices URL: `https://jdkrasnick.github.io/intern-notifs/support.html#delete-account`

The checked-in `mobile/ios/InternNotifs/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` mirrors these
categories. Generate Xcode's privacy report from the final archive and compare
it with this table before publishing the App Privacy answers.

## Google Play Data safety answers

### Top-level answers

- Does the app collect or share required user data types? **Collects data; does
  not share data with third parties for their own purposes.**
- Is all transmitted user data encrypted in transit? **Yes.**
- Can users request account and associated-data deletion? **Yes.**
- Account deletion web resource:
  `https://jdkrasnick.github.io/intern-notifs/support.html#delete-account`
- Has the app received an independent security review that qualifies for the
  Play badge? **No**, unless a qualifying review is completed later.

### Collected data types

| Google category/type | Optional or required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Location → Approximate location | Optional | App functionality; personalization |
| Personal info → Name | Optional | App functionality |
| Personal info → Email address | Optional | Account management; app functionality; security |
| Personal info → User IDs | Account ID optional; anonymous installation ID required | Account management; app functionality; security |
| Personal info → Address | Optional | App functionality |
| Personal info → Phone number | Optional | App functionality |
| Personal info → Other info | Optional | App functionality; includes education, work authorization, links, and reusable answers |
| App activity → App interactions | Optional | App functionality; personalization |
| App activity → In-app search history | Optional | App functionality |
| App activity → Other user-generated content | Optional | App functionality; application statuses, notes, and answers |
| Files and docs → Files and docs | Optional | App functionality; résumé/document storage |
| Device or other IDs → Device or other IDs | Installation ID required; push token optional | App functionality; security; requested notifications |
| App info and performance → Other app performance data | Required | App functionality; diagnostics; security |

For every row: select **collected**, **not shared**, **not processed for
advertising**, and the purposes above. Mark optional profile, account, alert,
and document fields optional because every user can browse without providing
them. The random installation identifier and basic service diagnostics are the
required data paths.

## Final submission reconciliation

Before the owner publishes either store form:

1. Build the exact release commit and generate the iOS privacy report.
2. Re-run `npm run release:check` in the EAS production environment.
3. Confirm all policy and deletion URLs return `200` over HTTPS without login.
4. Compare the final dependency lockfile and native permissions with this
   worksheet.
5. Publish the store answers, record the date and release commit below, and
   rerun physical-device account deletion.
