# Lever monitoring and recovery runbook

## Operator surface

Use `https://monitoring.jdkrasnick.com` for source health, incidents, queue
depth, alarms, recent trusted runs, and recovery controls. The site proxies the
private shared operations API; do not copy its server-to-server credential into
browser storage, source code, documentation, or shell history.

Each Lever source exposes these safe controls:

- **Pause / resume** — stop or restore scheduled work without a deployment.
- **Replay now** — enqueue one FIFO task for the selected source.
- **Set active / quiet** — switch between ten-minute and staggered six-hour
  polling.
- **Acknowledge / resolve** — record incident ownership and resolution.

Pause, cadence, and incident changes are versioned in the source health record.
Promotion between shadow and published remains a reviewed configuration change.

## Monthly monitoring review

The shared pane starts a fresh checklist each calendar month for both
Greenhouse and Lever:

- review fleet health and recent failed extractions;
- confirm both provider dead-letter queues are empty or understood;
- exercise pause, resume, and replay on one shadow source from each provider;
- verify alarm delivery; and
- confirm the latest nightly live contract.

A combined reminder is sent every Monday at 9:00 AM America/New_York while any
item remains incomplete. It includes current dead-letter messages, failed
extractions from the previous 24 hours, stale and quarantined sources, active
alarms, and queue depth. Completing every item suppresses email for the rest of
the month; the next month resets automatically.

## First response

1. Confirm whether the problem is one source, one Lever region, or the whole
   work queue.
2. Read the source's last trusted success, safe failure category, counts,
   retry/backoff state, and recent runs.
3. Confirm the dashboard says the catalog was preserved. A rejected or failed
   snapshot must not advance the checkpoint.
4. Acknowledge the incident, then use the matching procedure below.
5. Resolve only after a trusted success or a reviewed configuration repair.

## Failure procedures

### Global or EU Lever outage

- Check whether several sources in the same region are stale or returning
  temporary provider errors.
- Leave last-known-good catalog entries intact.
- Do not replay every source while provider backoff is active.
- Page when active sources cross 30 minutes or the work queue is exhausted.

### `429`, timeout, or `5xx`

- Inspect `backoffUntil`; bounded in-process retries have already run.
- Wait for provider backoff unless the provider has recovered.
- Replay one representative source before resuming broader work.
- Do not classify a temporary error as invalid configuration.

### Invalid site or region (`404`, `401`, `403`)

- Pause the source.
- Re-run the deterministic ownership and regional-host probe.
- Repair reviewed configuration and evidence; never guess a replacement site.
- Resume and replay once, then verify a trusted complete snapshot.

### Malformed JSON, schema drift, pagination, or duplicate IDs

- Keep the source paused or quarantined.
- Run the sanitized fixture contract to distinguish a code regression from
  upstream drift.
- For pagination, confirm every page completed and IDs are unique.
- Release a reviewed adapter fix before replaying production.

### Unexpected raw zero

- Compare against the last trusted raw count and the public board.
- Do not accept the empty snapshot after a previously non-empty board until the
  board closure is confirmed.
- A valid non-empty board with zero eligible internships is normal and may use
  quiet cadence.

### Application-host mismatch or broken links

- Withhold an isolated invalid role.
- Pause the source when the mismatch is widespread or changes region/site
  identity.
- Re-check first-party ownership evidence and the application redirect hosts.

### Catalog write or exhausted queue

- Stop replays until DynamoDB or the queue is healthy.
- Inspect the dead-letter count and worker alarm.
- Redrive only the selected source after catalog writes succeed.
- Deterministic outbox IDs and the quiet baseline keep safe replays from
  duplicating notifications.

## Recovery verification

A recovery is complete when:

- the selected source records a trusted `success_changed`,
  `success_unchanged_304`, or `success_unchanged_hash`;
- freshness returns below the applicable threshold;
- queue and dead-letter counts are normal;
- no identity, schema, pagination, or host-contract rejection remains; and
- the incident is resolved in the shared operations pane.
