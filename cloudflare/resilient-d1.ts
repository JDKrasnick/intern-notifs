/**
 * Wraps a D1 binding so reads, writes, and batches retry the transient D1
 * instance failures listed in RETRYABLE: an instance rotation, a deploy-time
 * reset, or a lost connection that rejects an in-flight statement. Each retry
 * rebuilds the statement so it runs against the reconnected instance.
 * Non-retryable errors propagate immediately and unchanged.
 *
 * Retrying writes is safe: these errors mean the instance rotated or was reset
 * before the statement committed (single statements autocommit; `batch` is
 * atomic), so a retried write never double-applies. Independently, the only
 * caller is the at-least-once queue consumer, whose whole batch already
 * re-runs every write on redelivery, so this in-request retry introduces no
 * duplication the pipeline does not already tolerate (ingestion writes upsert).
